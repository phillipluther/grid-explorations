                    This is a super-simplified implementation of a grid system to demonstrate the
                    basic concepts. Element spacing, margins/padding, and line heights snap to an 8pt
                    grid; text baselines snap to a 4pt vertical grid.

                    This is so UGLY! Why is this font this way? Why is that margin that way? I found
                    one thing I don't care for, negating everything you say from this point on.

                    It's a demo. It is not robust, nor complete, nor a plug-and-play system ready for
                    anybody to pick up and start app'ing. The demo CSS includes only the stuff needed
                    to demonstrate a few points and start discussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, the basics are in place. Nothing is fudged or cheated. It's a strict
                    8pt/4pt grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're not diggin' the choices I made RE: margins or font-sizes, you're
                    welcome to pop open your browser's inspector and modify them. I'd encourage
                    that, actually, to see how it improves or breaks the grid.
                </p>

                <h3 class="heading-4">And Actually, While We're Making Caveats ...</h3>
                <p>
                    You'll notice the text baselines can be 1px off above/below the text's rendered
                    baseline. For simplicity, I'm using system fonts. Good ol' <strong>sans-serif</strong>
                    and <strong>serif</strong>. I have no idea what those fonts might be or how they
                    might render on your system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also as mentioned, I didn't fudge any of the numbers. Another way of saying it,
                    I didn't <em>finesse</em> any of the numbers. Given time it's entirely possible
                    to fine tune those 1px oddities and make everything snap exactly to the baseline
                    grid.

                <p>
                    This is an 8pt grid at a 1x pixel ratio; that's a high-falutin' way of saying
                    it's an 8 pixel grid. Everything - margins, padding, widths, heights (including
                    line heights) - occur as multiples of 8px.
                </p>

                <h3 class="heading-4">Considerations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Font size doesn't affect the grid; line-height does</li>
                    <li>
                        I don't want my grid to break if a user changes their base font size; that's
                        not via CMD+/CTRL+, mind you, but if they actually set their font size to
                        something different than the browser default of 16px. This is a web
                        accessibility consideration.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <section>
                    <h3>Base/Default Font Size</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did was set my base font-size, as it'll serve as the basis
                        for doing <em>all</em> other grid calculations.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>html { font-size: 1em; }</code></pre>
                    <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong></p>
                    <p>
                        All browsers that matter use 16px as their default (unstyled) font size. I
                        set the base font-size to 1em, effectively saying, "Use the browser default,
                        which is probably 16px, to create the rest of our grid."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So yes - this could end up being a grid that's not based on 8px if a user
                        sets their default font size to something bigger or smaller. This is an
                        accessibility consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if the default font size changes, though, everything will still grid
                        properly - just at a larger or smaller scale. Eg., a user sets his/her
                        default font size to 24px because s/he has trouble reading small print. That
                        user will get a 12px grid.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Base/Default Line-height</h3>
                    <p>
                        Great. We've got a base font size that'll act as our primary unit of
                        measurement.
